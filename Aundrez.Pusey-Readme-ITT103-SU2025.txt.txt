            Hospital Management System
==================================================

 PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM:
--------------------------
This program is a **console-based Hospital Management System** written in Python. It allows hospital staff to:
- Register patients
- Add doctors and manage their available schedules
- Book appointments between patients and doctors
- View scheduled appointments
- Cancel existing appointments
- Generate bills for appointments

It uses object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

 HOW TO RUN:
---------------
1. Open the file using a Python IDE or text editor (e.g., VS Code, IDLE).
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
3. Run the script by executing:
4. The main menu will appear in the terminal/command prompt. Follow the prompts to use the system.

 REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS:
---------------------------
If you'd like to improve or extend this system, consider the following:
- Add a file/database system for saving patients, doctors, and appointments between sessions.
- Implement user authentication for admin login.
- Add GUI support using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Support rescheduling appointments.

 ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS:
-------------------------------
- All data is stored in memory (no database); data is lost when the program exits.
- Patient and Doctor IDs are automatically assigned (e.g., P001, D001).
- Time slots must be entered manually and exactly match the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.
- Billing is fixed at JMD$5000 per doctor visit, plus optional additional charges.
- Cancelled appointments do not yet restore the doctor's time slot automatically.
- Limited error handling for date/time parsing and missing input data.
